Analyze the following task for the **neural-network-toolbox** project — a neural network algorithms
library (activations, layers, losses, model) targeting resource-constrained embedded systems,
consuming shared numerical primitives from numerical-toolbox-cpp via FetchContent.
Gather relevant context from the codebase — identify affected modules, existing patterns,
the float-only numeric policy, and documentation requirements.
Then provide a brief scope summary and use the handoff buttons to route to the appropriate specialist:

- **Plan Implementation**: For complex tasks needing detailed upfront design (new algorithms, architectural changes, multi-file modifications)
- **Execute Directly**: For straightforward changes with a clear path (bug fixes, small improvements)
- **Review Code**: For reviewing existing or recently changed code against project standards

Task to orchestrate:
